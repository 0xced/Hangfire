    <summary>An easy way to perform fire-and-forget, delayed and recurring tasks inside ASP.NET applications. No Windows Service required.</summary>
    <description>
      An easy and reliable way to perform fire-and-forget, delayed and recurring long-running, short-running, CPU or I/O intensive tasks inside ASP.NET application. No Windows Service / Task Scheduler required. Even ASP.NET is not required.
      Backed by Redis, SQL Server, SQL Azure or MSMQ. This is a .NET alternative to Sidekiq, Resque and Celery.
